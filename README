This is an attempt at creating a nice Sequencer for linux and JACK friendly audio apps.

The software will rely extensively on QGraphicsView for display and score-editing.

°°Status :

  Currently, I have got basic GUI up and running and basic midi playback too!

°°Plans include :

  °Writing aids :

    - showing scales on note selection
    - showing notes from other tracks 
    - scripting API to enable quick writing of patterns

  °Easy setup of the actual audio rendering tools

    - Effortless configuration of DSSI plugins
    - Persistence of JACK connections

°°Coding philosophy / design :
    
    - try to keep a clean API for ease of extension
    - should have most functionality available outside the GUI
    - I want this to work soon, I don't need the sourcecode to be a work of high literary art
    - contributions highly welcome, commit policy will be rather souple

°°Compiling :

For now, since there is not much functionality yet, you will just need a recent Qt (I use 4.8) 
and a C++ compiler that has reasonable support of C++11 (at the moment I'm using the latest clang).
